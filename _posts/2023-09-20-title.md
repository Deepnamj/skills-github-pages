CHRIS EVANS TO RETIRE?
In a recent interview with GQ, Chris Evans confessed that he has not worked a day in 2023 and does not plan to in the near future. The 'Ghosted' actor said, "Yeah, maybe. I’ll never say never, just because it was such a wonderful experience. But I’m also very precious with it. It’s something that I am very proud of. And like I said, sometimes I can’t believe it even happened. And I wouldn’t want the black eye if it felt like a cash grab or if it didn’t live up to expectations or if it just felt like it wasn’t connected to that original thing. So, no time soon.
