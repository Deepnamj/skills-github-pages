CHRIS EVANS TO RETIRE?
In a recent interview with GQ, Chris Evans confessed that he has not worked a day in 2023 and does not plan to in the near future. The 'Ghosted' actor said, "Yeah, maybe. I’ll never say never, just because it was such a wonderful experience. But I’m also very precious with it. It’s something that I am very proud of. And like I said, sometimes I can’t believe it even happened. And I wouldn’t want the black eye if it felt like a cash grab or if it didn’t live up to expectations or if it just felt like it wasn’t connected to that original thing. So, no time soon.

Chris continued, "And ultimately, I really hope to just maybe act a little bit less in my life. I have a lot of other interests. Look, by no means have I climbed any sort of a mountain in this field. I have no Oscars and I’m not lumped with other names that are at the top of the mountain in any way. But I also feel very satisfied.”

CHRIS EVANS' WORK FRONT
Chris was seen in 'Ghosted' opposite Ana de Armas. Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie also made cameo appearances in the film. He also played the lead in the pharmaceutical thriller, 'Pain Hustlers', along with Emily Blunt, Catherine O'Hara, Andy Garcia and many others. The film was helmed by David Yates.
